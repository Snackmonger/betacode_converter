==================
BETACODE CONVERTER
==================



Abstract
--------

The program converts Greek betacode in the Latin alphabet into Greek characters, with the dicritical symbols incorporated into their appropriate
unicode mono-characters. The program is meant to provide the same sort of functionality as typegreek.com, but I did not want to base my design on
thw source code of that website (https://www.typegreek.com/typegreek.js). I did, however, want to provide the same sort of user experience as typegreek.com,
which deviates in some ways from the strict betacode conversion, so I have adopted all the changes listed here https://www.typegreek.com/alphabet.key/. 

When I use typegreek.com, I often lament the fact that the betacode conversion takes place in the same window as the Latin text entry. This situation means that once a
sequence has been recognized as valid betacode, it is automatically converted. Further betacode can add diacritics to a converted symbol, but once the diacritics are added,
the whole symbol must be deleted if a single correction needs to be made. Therefore, my version displays the raw betacode in a separate text box, so that the user can edit
diacritics as separate characters even after they have been converted.

Looking at the typegreek.com source code, as well as UniGreek (https://github.com/nicolasfranck/unigreek/blob/master/lib/UniGreek.pm), it looks like these approaches depend
on rather lengthy lists of 1:1 conversions for each individual combination. I wanted to do this a little more methodically, by assigning characteristics to characters in a 
particular unicode range, and then simply generating the right hex value. Unfortunately, the Greek Extended unicode block is a little less symmetrical than is ideal, so there
are a few necessary workarounds.

Basically just a lazy way to avoid learning keyboard shortcuts for macrons... but no doubt helpful to some people.
