==================
BETACODE CONVERTER
==================

Abstract
--------

The program converts Greek betacode in the Latin alphabet into Greek characters, with the dicritical symbols incorporated into their appropriate
unicode characters. The program is meant to provide the same sort of functionality as typegreek.com, but I did not want to base my design on
the source code of that website. I did, however, want to provide the same sort of user experience, so I have adopted all the changes to standard 
beta code listed here https://www.typegreek.com/alphabet.key/. 

When I use typegreek.com, I often lament the fact that the betacode conversion takes place in the same window as the Latin text entry. This situation means that once a
sequence has been recognized as valid betacode, it is automatically converted. Further betacode can add diacriticals to a converted symbol in some cases, but once the diacriticals 
are added, the whole symbol must be deleted if a single correction needs to be made. Therefore, my version displays the raw betacode in a separate text box, so that the user can edit
diacriticals as separate characters even after they have been converted.

I tried to look for a few other examples of programs that accomplish the same goal (see the ``/comparisons/`` folder). In most cases, it looks like these approaches depend
on rather lengthy lists of 1:1 conversions for each individual combination. I wanted to do this a little more methodically, by assigning characteristics to characters in a 
particular unicode range, and then simply generating the right hex value based on those characteristics. This turns out to be a bit like stealing from Peter to pay Paul; I spent
a week writing a program that would allow me to avoid spending a few hours typing out a series of combinations. 

The program was written in a very compartmentalized way. We can easily write custom token types, tokenizing strategies, and rendering functions to adapt to other language formats, and I will soon add
functionality for Latin text diacriticals (not simply for writing Latin text with macrons, etc., but also for languages like Vietnamese, where diacriticals are needed on vowels and consonants).
