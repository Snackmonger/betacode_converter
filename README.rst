BETACODE CONVERSION TOOL
------------------------
*This program is under active development, and behaviour may change without notice.*

This program was originally intended to convert 'betacode', an old fashioned way of formatting
polytonic Greek text before the unicode standard. There are still contexts where a user might want
to parse betacode (for instance, when working with XML texts from the Perseus digital library),
but a secondary use of the basic architecture is live text conversion, so that the user can type
Latin betacode and get the Greek characters with their appropriate diacritical marks.

From the basic architecture of the betacode conversion tool, the program was expanded to simplify the typing
of other Latin and non-Latin character sets that require diacritical marks and special combinations. I suppose 
that this is no longer simply a 'betacode' conversion tool, but this name's as good as any.
